Bash code:
sha256sum file1.txt
sha256sum file2.txt
Generate hash values for file1.txt and file2.txt using the SHA-256 algorithm.
Bash code:
sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash
sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash
Append the hash values to separate files, file1hash and file2hash.
Bash code:
cmp file1hash file2hash
Use the cmp command to compare the two hash files byte by byte. If a difference is detected, the command reports the byte and line number where the first disparity occurs.
Note: The output of the cmp command reveals that the hashes differ at the first character in the first line.
