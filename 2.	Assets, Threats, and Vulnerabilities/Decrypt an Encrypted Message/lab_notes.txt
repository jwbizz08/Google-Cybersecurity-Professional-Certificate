Conducting cryptographic operations for message decryption and encryption involves the utilization of specific commands, as exemplified below:
Character Translation with tr Command:
bash code:
cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z" 
•	The tr command translates text using character mappings.
•	The first parameter represents the input character set, and the second represents the output character set.
•	In this example, lowercase and uppercase letters are translated to their original positions.
File Decryption with open ssl Command:
bash code:
openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute 
•	The openssl command decrypts a file using the AES-256-CBC symmetric cipher.
•	The -pbkdf2 option enhances key security, and -a determines the output encoding.
•	The -d flag indicates decryption, while -in specifies the input file and -out specifies the output file.
•	The password for decryption is specified by the -k flag (e.g., "ettubrute").
In summary, these commands demonstrate a systematic approach to cryptographic processes, ensuring secure translation and decryption of messages through established protocols and ciphers. This information can be included in a GitHub file to document and share the procedures.
